  # Major: The first number indicates a major system upgrade
  # Minor: The second number indicates a minor system upgrade which
  #        may include system pacthes for improvements and small new features.
  # Maintenance: The third number indicates a maintenance system upgrade with

  # Example of this syntax:
  # WPBN: Wave Platform Build Number
  # P8102: First indicates the (PLATFORM_WAVE_VERSION_CODE) followed by the reversed year.
  # $(shell date -u +%d): Auto generated current day
  # $(shell date -u +%m): Auto generated current month
  # 646: Last 3 numbers are a reversed time code. Time codes are track from the current time
  #      the (PLATFORM_WAVE_MAINTENANCE_PATCH) get's updated and so on.
